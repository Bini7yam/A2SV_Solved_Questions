# [Minimum steps to delete a string](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-steps-to-delete-a-string2956/1)
## Medium
Given string s containing characters as integers only, the task is to delete all characters of this string in a minimum number of steps wherein one step you can delete the substring which is a palindrome. After deleting a substring remaining parts are concatenated.
Example 1:
Input: s = "2553432"
Output: 2
Explanation: In first step remove "55", 
then string becomes "23432" which is a 
palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "1234"
Output: 4
Explanation: Remove each character in 
each step
