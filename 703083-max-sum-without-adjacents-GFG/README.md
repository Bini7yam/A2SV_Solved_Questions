# [Max Sum without Adjacents](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-without-adjacents2430/1)
## Medium
Given an array&nbsp;arr&nbsp;containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum&nbsp;of elements of any possible subsequence such that no two numbers in the subsequence should be adjacent in array arr[].
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5]
Output: 110
Explanation: If you take indices 0, 3 and 5, then = 5+100+5 = 110.
Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 7, 10]
Output: 13
Explanation: 3 and 10 forms a non continuous subsequence with maximum sum.
Input: arr[] = [9, 1, 6, 10]
Output: 19
Explanation: 9 and 10 forms a non continuous subsequence with maximum sum.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ arri&nbsp;≤ 105
